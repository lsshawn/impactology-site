## Understanding Self-Awareness

Self-awareness involves a deep understanding of one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and values. For People & Culture Business Partners, this awareness can significantly impact how they interact with teams, handle conflicts, and drive organisational culture. By becoming more self-aware, professionals can align their actions with their values and lead more authentically.

## Tip 1: Embrace Reflective Practices

### Regular Self-reflection

Regular self-reflection is a powerful tool for enhancing self-awareness. Set aside time each day to reflect on your experiences, emotions, and reactions. Consider keeping a journal to document these reflections. This practice helps identify patterns in behaviour and thought processes, allowing for continuous personal growth.

### Mindfulness Meditation

Mindfulness meditation is another effective way to develop self-awareness. There's a reason why meditation is often recommended as a way of improving your self-awareness and overall wellbeing – it is because it works. By focusing on the present moment and observing your thoughts without judgement, you can gain deeper insights into your emotional responses and habitual behaviours. Incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine can lead to a more profound understanding of yourself.

## Tip 2: Seek Feedback

### Constructive Feedback from Colleagues

Soliciting feedback from colleagues is crucial for gaining a comprehensive view of your strengths and areas for improvement. Constructive feedback provides valuable insights that may not be apparent through self-reflection alone. Create an environment where colleagues feel comfortable sharing honest feedback, and be open to receiving it without defensiveness.

### 360-Degree Feedback

Consider implementing a 360-degree feedback system within your organisation. This approach gathers feedback from various sources, including peers, subordinates, and supervisors, offering a well-rounded perspective on your performance and behaviour. Anonymity in this process often encourages more candid and useful feedback.

## Tip 3: Engage in Professional Development

### Continuous Learning

Engaging in continuous learning opportunities is essential for personal and professional growth. Attend workshops, seminars, and training programmes specifically designed for People & Culture Business Partners. These programmes often include modules on emotional intelligence, leadership, and self-awareness.

### Relevant Training Programmes

Impactology offers tailored training for finance business partners, as well as for procurement and IT teams. These Programs are designed with specific niches in mind, providing relevant content that participants can directly relate to. The sessions are human-led, facilitated by experienced coaches who help leaders and teams work better within and between business units.

## Tip 4: Build Emotional Intelligence

### Recognise and Manage Emotions

Emotional intelligence (EI) is closely linked to self-awareness. Start by recognising your own emotions and understanding how they influence your thoughts and actions. Practice techniques to manage your emotions effectively, such as deep breathing, positive self-talk, and stress management strategies.

### Empathy and Social Awareness

Empathy is a critical component of EI. Cultivate the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. This skill not only enhances your interpersonal relationships but also helps in creating a positive and inclusive organisational culture. Being socially aware allows you to navigate complex social dynamics and foster a collaborative work environment.

#### Practical Applications in People & Culture

Enhancing Leadership Skills

By improving self-awareness, People & Culture Business Partners can enhance their leadership skills. Authentic leaders inspire trust and respect, making it easier to influence and motivate teams. Self-aware leaders are also better equipped to handle conflicts and make decisions that align with organisational values.

Improving Communication

Effective communication is a byproduct of high self-awareness. Understanding your communication style and recognising how it affects others enables you to adapt your approach. This adaptability leads to clearer, more empathetic interactions, fostering a positive workplace culture.

Aligning Personal and Organisational Values

When you are clear about your values, it becomes easier to align them with the organisation's mission and vision. This alignment ensures that your actions and decisions support the overall goals of the organisation, creating a harmonious and purpose-driven work environment.

#### The Impact of Self-awareness on Organisational Culture

Fostering Inclusivity

Self-aware People & Culture Business Partners play a crucial role in fostering an inclusive workplace culture. By understanding and managing their biases, they can create policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion. This approach not only enhances employee satisfaction but also drives organisational success.

Enhancing Employee Engagement

Employees are more likely to be engaged and motivated when they feel understood and valued. Self-aware leaders can create an environment where employees' voices are heard, and their contributions are recognised. This engagement leads to higher productivity and reduced turnover rates.

#### Conclusion: The Ongoing Journey

Enhancing self-awareness is an ongoing journey that requires commitment and effort. By embracing reflective practices, seeking feedback, engaging in professional development, and building emotional intelligence, People & Culture Business Partners can significantly improve their effectiveness and impact.

For those looking to further their development, consider exploring training for people & culture / HR business partners to gain a well-rounded understanding of business operations. This holistic approach will not only enhance your self-awareness but also contribute to your overall professional growth.

Self-awareness is not just about understanding oneself but also about leveraging that understanding to create a positive and productive organisational culture. By committing to this journey, People & Culture Business Partners can drive meaningful change and lead their organisations to new heights.
