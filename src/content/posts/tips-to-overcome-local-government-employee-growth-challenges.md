Local government faces a unique challenge: fostering employee growth while ensuring that the workforce is deeply connected to and responsive to community needs. With tight budgets, diverse stakeholder expectations, and increasing demands for innovation, leaders must strike a balance between internal development and external impact.

One solution that stands out is the [**Local Government Business Partnering IMPACT Program**](/business-partnering-impact-program) – a learning experience that aligns employee development with community engagement to create a more effective and responsive workforce. This blog explores four actionable tips to overcome employee growth challenges and build stronger connections with the communities councils serve.

## **1. Embrace the Concept of Business Partnering to Drive Change, Collaboration, and Trust**

At its core, [business partnering](/procurement-business-partnering) is about forging stronger relationships between employees, departments, and external stakeholders to achieve shared goals. For local government, this means empowering employees to act as strategic advisors, aligning their efforts with both organisational objectives and community needs.

### **How Business Partnering Helps Local Government:**

- **Drives Collaboration:** Breaks down silos by encouraging departments to work together toward common goals.
- **Enhances Trust:** Builds stronger relationships between council employees and community stakeholders, fostering transparency and accountability.
- **Encourages Proactivity:** Positions employees as strategic partners who anticipate challenges and deliver solutions aligned with community priorities.

### **Practical Action:**

- Train employees to think beyond their immediate tasks and understand the broader impact of their roles. Create a line of sight from the work your team completes and how it impacts the community.
- Equip teams with tools to engage stakeholders effectively, such as frameworks for stakeholder mapping and communication strategies.

## **2. Integrate Professional Development with Community Needs**

Professional development shouldn't occur in isolation; it must align with the specific needs and challenges of the communities your council serves. By integrating community insights into training programs, councils can ensure their workforce is better prepared to address local priorities and deliver meaningful outcomes.

### **How to Align Development With Community Needs:**

- **Understand the Community:** Leverage existing research and data to better understand local residents' key issues and priorities.
- **Incorporate Into Training Programs:** Incorporate these findings and insights into the Program learning experience – builds a connection between personal development and increasing knowledge of issues that impact the community.
- **Build Commercial Acumen:** Train staff to manage resources efficiently, create sustainable solutions, and engage in cost-effective decision-making that benefits the community. This can be done by better understanding how the council creates and delivers values to local residents.

### **Example:**

A council has experienced recurring natural disasters (e.g. flooding) in the last three years and as a result significant displacement. By integrating this insight into employee training, staff can gain an appreciation and understanding of what is important to local residents and how their work can directly and/or indirectly benefit the local area.

## **3. Foster Cross-Functional Collaborative Learning Opportunities**

Collaboration is at the heart of an effective local government. By creating opportunities for cross-functional learning, councils can encourage employees to share knowledge, solve problems creatively, and drive innovation.

### **The Benefits of Collaborative Learning:**

- **Improved Problem-Solving:** Teams with diverse perspectives are better equipped to tackle complex challenges.
- **Enhanced Communication:** Collaborative learning strengthens relationships and ensures alignment across departments.
- **Increased Innovation:** Sharing ideas and best practices leads to more creative and impactful solutions.

### **How to Promote Collaborative Learning:**

- **Facilitate Joint Workshops:** Bring employees from different departments to work on shared projects or solve community challenges.
- **Encourage Peer Mentorship:** Pair employees from different areas to exchange insights and build new skills.

## **4. Foster a Culture of Continuous Learning for Improved Personal Development.**

A skilled workforce is the cornerstone of any successful local government. Building a culture that values continuous learning ensures employees are always improving, adapting, and innovating in response to changing community needs.

### **How to Build a Culture of Continuous Learning:**

- **Lead by Example:** Encourage senior leaders to participate in training and demonstrate their commitment to personal growth.
- **Provide Regular Feedback:** Create a system for continuous feedback and reflection, helping employees identify areas for improvement and celebrate successes.
- **Recognise and Reward Growth:** Acknowledge employees who embrace learning and apply their new skills to benefit the community.

### **Practical Action:**

- Develop a long-term learning strategy that aligns with council goals and community needs.
- Offer flexible learning opportunities, such as microlearning modules, on-demand courses, or virtual workshops.
- Use metrics to measure the impact of learning initiatives on employee performance and community engagement.
