Local councils (LGAs) face increasing pressure to do more with less. Tight budgets, growing community expectations, and evolving societal and technological challenges demand innovative solutions. Limited resources might seem like a roadblock to employee growth and community engagement, but they can also be an opportunity to rethink and refine how councils invest in their most valuable asset: their people.

This blog explores three strategies that local councils can adopt to foster employee growth and strengthen community engagement, even under budget constraints. By adopting these approaches, councils can build a resilient workforce and enhance their service delivery to residents.

## **The Importance of Employee Growth for Local Councils**

Employee growth for local councils goes beyond traditional professional development—it involves creating a workforce that is well-equipped to navigate the complexities of serving diverse communities. Employees who are engaged, empowered, and skilled are more likely to:

- **Deliver exceptional service:** Improved skills and engagement translate to higher-quality service for residents.
- **Navigate cross-department collaboration:** Collaboration becomes smoother and more productive, breaking down silos within the council.
- **Drive innovation:** Employees who are encouraged to learn and grow bring creative solutions to internal challenges and community needs.

Investing in employee growth benefits internal operations and has a direct, positive impact on the communities councils serve. When employees feel valued and equipped, they can better engage with residents and respond to community needs with empathy and efficiency.

### **Strategy 1: Prioritise High-Impact, Cost-Effective Development Programs**

Limited budgets don't mean councils can't invest in their teams. The key is to focus on initiatives that deliver maximum impact for minimal cost.

#### **What This Looks Like:**

- **Skill-Based Training:** Focus on programs that build practical, transferable skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and stakeholder engagement. These skills empower employees to handle diverse challenges effectively.
- **Cross-Department Collaboration:** Establish collaboration programs enabling knowledge-sharing between employees with similar experience or between seasoned employees and newer team members. This builds internal capabilities without requiring significant financial investment.
- **Leverage Internal Expertise:** Tap into the organisation's wealth of experience. Internal experts can lead workshops or knowledge-sharing sessions, providing growth opportunities without external costs.

#### **How This Enhances Community Engagement:**

Employees who feel valued and equipped are more confident and motivated to engage meaningfully with residents and community stakeholders, leading to stronger relationships and better outcomes.

#### **Pro Tip for Councils:**

Consider establishing "Lunch and Learn" sessions where employees can share expertise on key topics. This informal, low-cost approach fosters knowledge sharing and professional development.

### **Strategy 2: Encourage Self-Directed Development for Continuous Growth**

Even with tight budgets, employees can take charge of their development by seeking learning opportunities beyond formal council-led programs. Empowering individuals to pursue self-directed learning cultivates a mindset of growth and adaptability.

#### **What This Looks Like:**

- **Cost-Effective Learning Resources:** Encourage employees to explore free or low-cost platforms such as podcasts, industry blogs, and open-access learning modules to build essential skills.
- **Peer-Led Learning Sessions:** Foster an environment where employees can volunteer to share knowledge and best practices through informal sessions or lunch-and-learns.
- **Personal Growth Plans:** Encourage employees to set self-development goals aligned with their role and community impact. Offer guidance on how to create achievable and relevant learning objectives.
- **Local Networking and Events:** Promote opportunities to attend industry events, meetups, or professional groups that can broaden employees' knowledge and connections.

#### **How This Enhances Community Engagement:**

Employees who proactively seek personal growth are more engaged, innovative, and equipped to address evolving community needs. When employees bring fresh insights and ideas back to their teams, councils benefit from stronger collaboration and creative solutions without incurring significant expenses.

#### **Pro Tip for Councils:**

Shift the mindset toward a learning culture where employees feel encouraged to explore self-driven growth, contributing new ideas and innovations to council operations.

### **Strategy 3: Foster a Culture of Continuous Learning**

A culture that values growth, adaptability, and innovation can transform councils' operations, even with limited budgets.

#### **What This Looks Like:**

- **Encourage Feedback and Reflection:** Create opportunities for employees to reflect on their work and identify areas for growth, fostering a mindset of continuous improvement.
- **Reward Learning and Initiative:** Recognize and reward employees who pursue growth opportunities, even if informal, to encourage a learning-focused environment.
- **Align Development With Goals:** Tie learning initiatives to organisational and community objectives, ensuring employees see the value and relevance of their growth.

#### **How This Enhances Community Engagement:**

A workforce that embraces learning is more adaptable, innovative, and better prepared to meet the community's changing needs.

#### **Pro Tip for Councils:**

Implement "Learning Champions" within departments who can advocate for continuous learning and share best practices.
