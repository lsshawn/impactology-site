Local government leaders face a unique and demanding challenge: delivering exceptional services to their communities while managing diverse teams, tight budgets, and complex stakeholder relationships. Success in this environment requires a workforce that is not only skilled but also collaborative, trustworthy, and commercially aware.

This article explores three strategies that local government leaders can use to develop these capabilities in their teams.

## Strategy 1: Build Trust Through Transparency and Consistency

Trust is the foundation of effective teams. In local government, where decisions affect communities directly, trust is especially critical.

Building trust requires:

- **Transparency:** Share information openly, even when it's uncomfortable
- **Consistency:** Follow through on commitments and maintain predictable standards
- **Integrity:** Act in the best interests of the community, not personal agendas
- **Vulnerability:** Admit mistakes and ask for help when needed

Leaders who model these behaviours create an environment where team members feel safe to take risks, speak up, and collaborate.

## Strategy 2: Foster Cross-Functional Collaboration

Local government services often span multiple departments. Effective collaboration across these silos is essential for delivering integrated, citizen-centric services.

Fostering collaboration:

- **Break down silos:** Create opportunities for teams to work together on shared projects
- **Shared goals:** Align departmental objectives with whole-of-organisation outcomes
- **Communication:** Establish regular forums for cross-departmental dialogue
- **Recognition:** Celebrate collaborative wins, not just individual achievements

## Strategy 3: Develop Commercial Acumen

While local government isn't driven by profit, commercial acumen is still essential. Understanding costs, value, and resource allocation helps teams make better decisions and deliver more with limited budgets.

Developing commercial acumen:

- **Financial literacy:** Ensure all team members understand budgets and financial constraints
- **Value focus:** Encourage teams to think about the value they deliver, not just the tasks they complete
- **Efficiency:** Look for opportunities to reduce costs without compromising service quality
- **Innovation:** Encourage creative solutions to deliver better outcomes within budget

## Conclusion

Local government leaders can transform their teams by focusing on trust, collaboration, and commercial acumen. These capabilities are essential for delivering exceptional services in a challenging environment.
