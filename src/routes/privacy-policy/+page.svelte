				<p>
					This privacy policy applies to the management of your personal information (&ldquo;Your
					Information&rdquo;) by or on behalf of Impactology Pty. Ltd.
					(&ldquo;Impactology&rdquo;/&ldquo;we&rdquo; / &ldquo;us&rdquo;/ &ldquo;our&rdquo;).
				</p>

				<p>
					Impactology provides programs, events, and consulting services (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;).
					These Services may be provided from time to time via our website www.impactology.com.au or
					via various software as a service applications which we use to provide our Services
					(together &ldquo;Systems&rdquo;).
				</p>

				<p>
					We have created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to the Privacy
					Act 1988 Cth (&ldquo;Privacy Act&rdquo;) and the Australian Privacy Principles, and
					specify how we may collect, hold, use or disclose Your Information. This Privacy Policy
					also applies in relation to the collection, use and disclosure of Your Information under
					various State based privacy laws (to the extent that they apply to us).
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">What information do we collect?</h2>
				<p>
					We access, collect and hold Your Information, which may include your name, phone number,
					email, mailing address, employer (i.e the relevant customer or supplier whom you are
					associated with) and other information relevant to the supply of our Services that is
					collected by us or that you choose to provide to us. Our clients may also provide us with
					Your Information or access to a system or database that holds Your Information to enable
					us to provide our Services to the relevant client. The type of information which we are
					exposed to in this regard will vary by client and the goods and services they provide.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">How we collect Your Information</h2>
				<p>
					Generally, we collect Your Information directly from you but we may also collect or access
					Your Information from other people or organisations if you have given your consent. We may
					collect Your Information from our clients whilst providing our Services to them. This
					collection may be temporary (i.e. for a short period whilst we provide our clients with
					Services) or over a longer term (e.g.: such as where we enter into long term projects with
					our clients). We also may collect or have access to Your Information as part of providing
					and offering our Services to you.
				</p>
				<p>This includes when you provide Your Information to us by:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>using our Services;</li>
					<li>registering to use the Systems;</li>
					<li>completing any forms on the Systems or as otherwise required by us;</li>
					<li>making any requests or transactions through the Systems; or</li>
					<li>
						communicating with us in person, during phone calls, by email, or otherwise via customer
						enquiries or communications.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Why do we need Your Information?</h2>
				<p>
					We only collect or hold Your Information where it is reasonably necessary for our business
					functions or activities, including the provision of our Services and Systems.
				</p>
				<p>In particular, we need Your Information to:</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						enable you and any client with whom you are associated with to access and use the
						Services and the Systems we provide as part of the Services;
					</li>
					<li>
						operate, supply, maintain and improve our Services and the Systems we provide to our
						clients;
					</li>
					<li>monitor the client&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations with us;</li>
					<li>administer your account or the relevant client&rsquo;s account with us;</li>
					<li>
						provide you or our clients with our Services (including by analysing Your Information
						and logging all interactions with the Systems);
					</li>
					<li>keep and update internal records;</li>
					<li>communicate with you and/or the client about our Services;</li>
					<li>create and update our databases and other records;</li>
					<li>
						ensure compliance with our contractual and other legal obligations to you or the client;
						and
					</li>
					<li>
						administer our relationship with you or the client by responding to your enquiries or
						the client&rsquo;s enquiries, (the &ldquo;Main Purposes&rdquo;).
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Information that is provided by clients or their authorised users and held in the Systems
					we provide as part of our Services may also be accessed and used by clients for their own
					purposes (as determined by the client).
				</p>
				<p>
					If you do not allow us to collect Your Information or access Your Information stored in
					the Systems we provide as part of the Services, we may not be able to fulfil our Main
					Purposes or supply our Services (including access to and use of any of the Systems) to you
					or the client with whom you are associated.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">How do we use or disclose Your Information?</h2>
				<p>
					By submitting Your Information to us, you consent to us using or disclosing Your
					Information for:
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>the Main Purposes;</li>
					<li>to the nominated representative of any client you are associated with;</li>
					<li>
						a manner as directed or as agreed by the client that provided (or whose authorised user
						provided) the information to us;
					</li>
					<li>
						providing the relevant client or its authorised users with access to or use of the
						Systems we provide as part of our Services;
					</li>
					<li>
						the protection of the rights, property or personal safety of any client or
						client&rsquo;s authorised users, any member of the public, or to protect our interests;
					</li>
					<li>
						any purpose related to the Main Purposes that could be reasonably anticipated at the
						time Your Information was collected (&ldquo;Secondary Purpose&rdquo;);
					</li>
					<li>
						any purpose to which you otherwise consent (including as disclosed to you in an
						information collection statement at the point where we collect Your Information);
					</li>
					<li>
						in the event of a reorganisation, merger, sale, assignment, bankruptcy or other
						disposition of our business, in which case the transferred information will remain
						subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy or a privacy policy in substantially similar
						terms; and
					</li>
					<li>any other purpose required or authorised by law (including the Privacy Act).</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Secondary Purposes may include but are not limited to: improving our Services; sending you
					or the client direct marketing about our Services, deals and promotions; conducting
					customer surveys; managing our relationship with you; monitoring how you interact with us
					on the Systems or other contact points; or helping you to complete an activity that you
					have chosen to undertake.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may use certain non-personally identifiable information (such as usage data, IP
					addresses, browser or platform type etc.) subject to applicable law to share results with
					the applicable client, to develop and improve the quality of our Services and customise
					the product experience for each user, and to create new features, promotions,
					functionality and services by storing, tracking, analysing and processing user preferences
					and trends as well as user activity and communications.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Can you remain anonymous or use a pseudonym?</h2>
				<p>
					We will, if practicable, allow you to use a pseudonym or to not identify yourself (unless
					this is impractical or against the law (including the Privacy Act)). In many instances, if
					you do not provide us with some of Your Information we may not be able to provide you with
					the relevant service, product or information. This may have an effect on whether we can
					begin or continue a relationship with you.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">What disclosures do we make?</h2>
				<p>
					Generally speaking (and as described above under the heading &ldquo;How do we use or
					disclose Your Information&rdquo;) we will disclose Your Information for the Main Purposes.
					We may also disclose Your Information in other ways with your consent or to any other
					party where we are authorised or required to do so by law (including the Privacy Act).
				</p>
				<p>
					We may disclose Your Information to our partners, suppliers, distributors and service
					providers in order to assist us in providing our Services to you or our clients. Your
					Information, whether collected directly by us, or provided to us by you, may either be
					hosted on servers we control, or on servers controlled by our partners, suppliers,
					distributors and service providers, to which we are given access.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of our service providers or the services they provide (like cloud storage services),
					may be based outside Australia, including in places like the United States of America,
					Europe and Asia. In order to protect Your Information, we take care where possible to work
					with service providers whom we consider maintain acceptable standards of data security
					compliance, and we do our part to meet those standards as they apply to us. By providing
					us with Your Information, you consent to Your Information being used, stored and disclosed
					overseas (and acknowledge that no additional obligations that may apply to the overseas
					disclosure of personal information other than those specified in the Privacy Act will
					apply).
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Is Your Information confidential and secure?</h2>
				<p>
					We take all reasonable steps to keep Your Information secure and to ensure it is protected
					against misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or inappropriate disclosure.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Do we use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; and other tracking technologies?</h2>
				<p>
					When a client or any of its authorised users use the Systems, our servers may collect the
					Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with the user&rsquo;s computer. We may also
					collect additional information such as the login timestamp, the user&rsquo;s browser type
					and version, and the operating system of the user&rsquo;s computer.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may from time to time use cookies to collect information about an individual
					user&rsquo;s use of the Systems. Cookies are small data files sent by a website or
					application and stored on the computer or device at the request of that site or app.
					Cookies store information related to a user&rsquo;s browser, user name and unique
					identifier which enable us to recognize the browser on return visits to the Systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may use third-party service providers to assist us in collecting and understanding the
					usage information. Most browsers can be set to detect browser cookies and to let a user
					reject them, but refusing cookies may make it difficult to use the Systems. By using the
					Systems, you agree to the use of these tracking technologies.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Third party service providers</h2>
				<p>
					The Systems may contain links to other websites, platforms or applications and our
					Services may include the use of other platforms or services provided by third party
					service providers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the owners of those
					websites, platforms, or applications. We recommend that you read the privacy policy of any
					website, platform, or application that asks you to provide Your Information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of those third party service providers, or the services they provide, may be based
					outside of Australia. We take care to work with service providers who we consider maintain
					acceptable standards of data security compliance. By providing us with your personal
					information, you consent to that information being used, stored and disclosed outside of
					Australia.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
					We may need to change this privacy policy from time to time. When we do amend it, the
					changes will be effective immediately upon being made public on our website at
					www.impactology.com.au. We will use reasonable measures to notify you of any relevant
					changes to this privacy policy, but please be aware that it is your responsibility to
					review our privacy policy regularly and make sure you keep up to date with any changes.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Managing Your Information</h2>
				<p>
					You are responsible for ensuring that Your Information is accurate, current and complete
					and we encourage you to contact us to update Your Information if it changes at:
					<a href="mailto:hello@impactology.com.au">hello@impactology.com.au</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					You may ask to access Your Information in accordance with the Privacy Act, including by
					asking us to provide you with a summary of Your Information that we hold subject to any
					limitations at law.
				</p>
				<p>
					For your protection, we may require you to confirm your identity before access to Your
					Information is granted. In most cases, we can provide you with a summary of Your
					Information free of charge. However, in some circumstances, reasonable costs may be
					charged to you in accessing Your Information in accordance with and subject to the Privacy
					Act or any other relevant law.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may opt-out of receipt of emails, or other commercial messages delivered by us on
					behalf of our clients by clicking on the &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; button that appears on
					the bottom of each email. You may also contact any client with whom you are associated to
					request further access to, modification of, or deletion of Your Information provided to us
					by the client.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Queries and complaints</h2>
				<p>
					If you have a question or want to make a complaint about how we handle Your Information,
					please contact us using the details below. We will review any question, complaint or
					concern you may have and will respond to you after we have carefully considered it. We
					will, where reasonably possible, take steps to investigate and resolve complaints within
					30 days. Please note, we may require further information from you in order to resolve any
					complaints. If we need more time, we will notify you about the reasons for the delay and
					seek to agree a longer period with you (if you do not agree, we may not be able to resolve
					your complaint). If we cannot resolve a complaint related to your privacy information, you
					may contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (&ldquo;OAIC&rdquo;)
					directly.
