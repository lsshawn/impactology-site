					This privacy policy applies to the collection, use, and management of your Personal Data
					(defined below) by or on behalf of IMPACTORA PTY LTD ACN 673 812 603 its subsidiaries and

				<p>
					Impactora offers software as a service and associated mobile or tablet applications

					tailored to the individual employee and their business. This Privacy Policy applies to all
					Personal Data collected by us, including Personal Data collected or submitted through our

				<p>
					We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to the Australian Privacy
					Act 1988 Cth (&ldquo;<strong>Privacy Act</strong>&rdquo;), the Australian Privacy
					Principles and other applicable Australian privacy laws (together, the
					&ldquo;<strong>Australian Privacy Laws</strong>&rdquo;) as well as the privacy laws of
					other countries which may apply including without limitation the EU General Data Protection
					Regulation (2016/679), UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (together,
					&ldquo;<strong>Data Protection Laws</strong>&rdquo;). It sets out how we may collect, hold,
					use or disclose your Personal Data. Other terms may also apply to you and the Personal Data
					we hold about you (for example where we provide you with a specific privacy collection
					notice or if our Data Processing Agreement applies).
				</p>

				<p>
					In collecting Personal Data, by law, we are required to provide you with information about
					us, about why and how we use your Personal Data, and about the rights you have over your
					Personal Data. If you do not agree with this policy you should not access or use our
					website or Services or otherwise interact with our business.

				<h2 class="text-2xl">Your rights under EU/UK data protection laws</h2>
