				</p>

				<!-- Section 1 -->
				<h2 class="text-2xl">1. SOFTWARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT</h2>

				<p>
					1.1 This Agreement sets out your usage rights in relation to the Software. The Software
					Purchase Agreement (defined below) sets out particulars of your purchase of those usage
					rights, including the matters described in this clause.
				</p>

				<p>
					1.2 This Agreement is incorporated by reference into the Software Purchase Agreement.
					Without limiting the forgoing, the Software Purchase Agreement may constitute a Master
					Services Agreement between the Licensor and the Client, a purchase order form pursuant to
					which the Client purchases the Licence, a mobile application signup process, or other
					software purchase agreement which references this document and is entered by the Client
					and the Licensor (<strong>Software Purchase Agreement</strong>).
				</p>

				<p>
					1.3 The Software Purchase Agreement may specify (amongst other things):
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						the type of Licence you are granted (being either an Enterprise Licence or a Consumer
						Licence) (jointly referred to as <strong>Licence</strong>);

					<li>
						the term of the Licence (being either an Evaluation Term, a Subscription Term, or on a
						Free Trial basis);
					</li>
					<li>
						how the Client may access and use the Software (including the applicable Licence
						conditions described in clause 2);
					</li>
					<li>
						any usage rights and/or usage limits in respect of the functionality of the Software;
					</li>
					<li>the provision of software support by the Licensor;</li>
					<li>
						the provision of other services by the Licensor (such as consulting, installation, and
						maintenance);
					</li>
					<li>
						(if applicable) that the licence be activated by licence keys which allow the use of
						the Software; and
					</li>
					<li>
						any other special terms governing the Licence or which are expressly stated to take
						precedence over a term of this Agreement.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					1.4 If there is any conflict between the Software Purchase Agreement, and this Agreement,
					then subject to clause 1.3(h) and unless otherwise expressly specified in the Software
					Purchase Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will prevail to the extent of the
					conflict.
				</p>

				<!-- Section 2 -->
				<h2 class="text-2xl">2. SOFTWARE LICENCE CONDITIONS</h2>

				<p>
					2.1 Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Licensor, the Client and if applicable,
					its Authorised Users, may only use and access the Software to the extent permitted by
					this Agreement.
				</p>

				<p>
					2.2 The Software which is licenced to the Client under this Agreement is either (as
					indicated in the Software Purchase Agreement):
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						a web based software as a service application which is accessible via a website
						specified from time to time by the Licensor (<strong>SAAS Application</strong>);
						and/or
					</li>
					<li>
						a smart phone or tablet application published by the Licensor from time to time in one
						or more of the Apple Appstore, or any other online software distribution service
						(<strong>APP</strong>).
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					2.3 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, where the Software Purchase Agreement
					indicates the Client elects an Enterprise Licence, the Licensor grants to the Client, a
					non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence:
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						to access and use the Software and the Material online via the SAAS Application;
					</li>
					<li>
						to access and use any APP version the Software and Materials which the Licensor makes
						available during the Term; and
					</li>
					<li>
						to make the SaaS Application and APP versions of Software and Material available for
						use by specific named individual users, or a fixed number of concurrent users, who hold
						an individual licence to use and access the Software (each an &ldquo;Authorised
						User&rdquo;) (but only to the extent specified in the Software Purchase Agreement)
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					(together, <strong>Enterprise Licence</strong>). An Enterprise Licence may be granted for

					non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the APP version of the Software
					and Material purchased or otherwise accessed by the Client via the relevant application
					store (<strong>Consumer Licence</strong>). A Consumer Licence may be granted to the
					Client on a Trial basis under clause 3.2(b) or for a Subscription Term under clause
					3.2(c). For the avoidance of doubt, a Consumer Licence does not grant the Client any
					right to access or otherwise use the SAAS Application.
				</p>

				<p>
					2.5 If the Software Purchase Agreement does not nominate the licence type and or term,
					then the Licensor grants to the Client a Consumer Licence for a Trial Period.

					2.6 The Client and if applicable, its Authorised Users must only use the Software and
					Materials as permitted by this Agreement and in accordance with applicable user manuals

					<li>
						directly or indirectly attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Software (or its
						related systems or networks);
					</li>
					<li>

						libellous, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene or otherwise
						objectionable;
					</li>
					<li>
						upload to the Software any viruses, malware or any other malicious software or data; or
					</li>
					<li>
						license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, deliver, transfer, assign, distribute,
						time share, offer the Software or the Licence to any other person without the written
						permission of the Licensor.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>

				</p>

				<p>
					2.8 All rights in and to the Software and Materials which are not expressly granted under
					this Agreement are strictly reserved by the Licensor.
				</p>

				<!-- Section 3 -->
				<h2 class="text-2xl">3. TERM</h2>

				<p>
					3.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the payment of any applicable fee),
					the relevant Licence will be granted to the Client upon the Client entering into a
					Software Purchase Agreement.
				</p>

				<p>
					3.2 The term of the Licence will be indicated in the Software Purchase Agreement and may
					be either:
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						in the case of an Enterprise Licence only &ndash; granted by the Licensor for a
						limited time for the purpose of enabling the Client to evaluate whether the Software is
						fit for its required purpose, or to trial any beta version of the Software
						(<strong>Evaluation Term</strong>). During the Evaluation Term, the Software may have
						limited functionality, be in beta format or have other limitations imposed on its use
						by the Licensor. At the conclusion of the Evaluation Term, the Enterprise Licence will
						automatically terminate unless the Client enters into a Subscription Term (as defined
						below);
					</li>
					<li>
						in the case of Consumer Licence only &ndash; be granted for a trial period. This means
						you will be granted access to the mobile application for a specified limited period (as
						indicated within the application), allowing you to evaluate the mobile application
						during that period (<strong>Trial Period</strong>); or
					</li>
					<li>
						be granted on a subscription basis. That is, the Enterprise Licence or APP License will
						be granted for a specific period of time (as set out in the Software Purchase
						Agreement), which is capable of automatic renewal under clause 3.5
						(<strong>Subscription Term</strong>);
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>(each a <strong>Term</strong>).</p>

				<p>
					3.3 The Licence will commence on the date of the Software Purchase Agreement (or on such
					other date as specified in the Software Purchase Agreement) and shall continue for the
					applicable Term unless terminated or renewed in accordance with this Agreement.
				</p>

				<p>
					3.4 At the end of the Trial Period, unless either party terminates this Agreement under
					clause 7.2(e) or 7.4(d), the Subscription Term will automatically commence the day after
					the end of the Trial Period.
				</p>

				<p>
					3.5 Unless the Software Purchase Agreement states otherwise, at the end of each
					Subscription Term the Client&rsquo;s Licence will automatically renew for a new
					Subscription Term of the same duration (each a <strong>Renewal Term</strong>). However,
					the Client or the Licensor may provide written notice to the other party of their
					intention not to renew and to terminate this Agreement, with such notice to be provided no
					less than 30 days prior to the then current Term. Where notice is given under this clause
					3.5, access to the Software will continue until the end of the then current Term following
					which the provisions of clause 7.5 will apply. For the avoidance of doubt, no refunds
					will be given for the pro-rated amount remaining from the date of notice until the end of
					the then current term, unless required under this Agreement or by law.
				</p>

				<p>
					3.6 On renewal, the Client acknowledges that the Licensor may charge a new licence fee or
					other amount specified in the Software Purchase Agreement (or if not specified, then the
					Licensor&rsquo;s standard fee for the type and extent of rights granted) in respect of
					the Renewal Term.
				</p>

				<p>
					3.7 The Client acknowledges that the Licensor is under no obligation to renew a
					Subscription Term or agree to grant a renewal to the Client after request from the
					Client.

					access additional Software functionality described in the Software Purchase Agreement or
					otherwise which the Licensor makes generally available to Administrators from time to
					time. An Authorised User must be an employee of, consultant or subcontractor to the
					Client. An Authorised User must not be another legal entity (including the Client&rsquo;s
					related bodies corporate or any other organisation (who will need to purchase their own

					Agreement that the Client&rsquo;s related bodies corporate or personnel of such related
					bodies corporate be permitted to act as Authorised Users.
				</p>

				<p>
					4.3 The number of Administrators and General Users who may use the Software will be as
					specified in the Software Purchase Agreement. The Client must not exceed these usage
					limits.

					<li>
						the rights granted to the Licensor under this Agreement in respect of, or against, the
						Client, will also be granted by you to the Licensor (as if you were the Client).

				</ol>

				<p>
					4.5 The Client shall be responsible for each use of the Software by its Authorised Users.
					Each act, omission or negligence of an Authorised User in relation to its use of the
					Software, or this Agreement, shall be an act, omission or negligence of the Client. The
					Client indemnifies the Licensor against any and all loss, cost, expense or damage suffered
					or incurred by the Licensor, as a result of any and all uses of the Software by the
					Client or its Authorised Users, and from any breach of this Agreement or any Third Party

					<li>doing so is required for urgent maintenance of the Software.</li>

				<!-- Section 6 -->
				<h2 class="text-2xl">6. FEES &amp; EXPENSES</h2>

				<p>
					6.1 The Client agrees to pay the Licensor the fees and expenses by the due date and
					method specified in any invoice (or within 14 days of the date of any invoice if no due
					date is specified), or in accordance with any payment terms otherwise agreed in Software
					Purchase Agreement.
				</p>

				<p>
					6.2 In the case of an APP Licence &ndash; unless either party terminates this Agreement

					the fees and expenses.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl">7. TERMINATION</h2>

				<p>
					7.1 This Agreement and the Licence will automatically expire and terminate:

						if an Enterprise Licence is granted for an Evaluation Term, then at the end of the
						applicable Evaluation Term unless extended by agreement with the Licensor; or
					</li>

						if a Subscription Term is purchased, then at the end of the applicable term if the
						Enterprise Licence or Consumer Licence (as applicable) is not renewed and terminated by
						either party under clause 3.5.

					</li>
					<li>
						the Client will delete or destroy, or where specified by the Licensor, return to the
